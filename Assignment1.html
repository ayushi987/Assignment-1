            <h1>ABNEGATION FACTION</h1>
        <p>
            Abnegation is one of the five factions in the world of Divergent. 
            Members from Abnegation value selflessless to the point of forgetting themselves for the sake of others. 
            Their substance in the Choosing Ceremony are smooth gray stones. 
            Abnegation is the faction that the main protagonist, Tris Prior, was born into. As such, it holds importance to the novel's plot. 
            The selflessness that Tris was brought up with is what gave her strength in her new faction, Dauntless. 
            At the end of the novel, Abnegation was overthrown from the government by an alliance between Erudite and Dauntless, causing a collapse of the government. 
            Most of its leaders, as well as the majority of its people, were killed during the initial confrontation, although some people were able to flee to Amity.
            Abnegation's main leader, Marcus Eaton, was not killed during the genocide. After the war, the remaining Abnegation members left and stayed with other factions, like Candor and Amity, or became Factionless.

            Abnegation values the virtue of selflessness over any other. Abnegation initiates, upon attaining membership, are forced to reject a life of vanity and self-indulgence, protecting themselves from greed and envy which are considered forms of selfishness. Things like gossiping, using the mirror for long periods of time or often and buying luxury items are forbidden. As Abnegation members, the focus of their lives will be to serve others instead of themselves, therefore, anything done for self-enjoyment is discouraged. Abnegation are usually very quiet as they don't like to attract attention to themselves. They typically find satisfaction in helping others.

Members of the Abnegation faction are expected to be compliant to others at all times, even if that person is in Abnegation as well, e.g. they take the stairs to allow the elevators to be used by others. It is not unnatural for strangers on the streets to have an Abnegation helping them with anything such as carrying their groceries or treating an injury. Immoral actions are not a trait of an Abnegation, such as the usage of guns for violence. The faction mandates that guns should be only used for self-defense. However, as self-defense is a form of self-preservation, it is considered selfish and is discouraged. Their morally incorruptible quality makes them the only reasonable faction to be able to govern the city as political leaders, but because of their apparent submissive nature, it oftentimes causes other factions to think of them as weak.

City leaders are typically hand-picked from Abnegation, as it is generally believed that the faction's desire to put others before themselves are key factors for true leadership that renders a ruling government incorruptible.

            The main goal of Abnegation people is to forget oneself and serve others, so they wear gray clothing to be less noticeable as they prefer simplistic functionality over frivolous style. Abnegation clothes are very baggy and gray robes are also common among members and children. Women usually pin up their hair and men have their hair cut short. Abnegation cut their hair every three months and every six months they pick up a stack of new clothing that is identical to what they were wearing for the past six months. The only adornment that they are allowed is a simple gray watch.
            Abnegation people greet each other by formally bowing their heads, as physical contact is discouraged and therefore, feared. Physical displays of affection are forbidden and kissing in public is seen as a disgusting act.
